 My goal is to create basic recipe application. 

So as to  fetch the data, I used  "https://api.edamam.com/" API.

This is the first time I practised private and  authtenticaded routes .
 
 Techniques that I  implemented in this project;
 *****
Creating basic login page for the authentication,

--Using React-Router  Library to facilitate easy page transisition,

--Adopting Styled Components for styling each and every component,

--Using Themes and Global variables, 

--Creating custom react hook by using useContext for authentication,

--Using axios for fetching the API from the server,
