# my recipe-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Website Link](https://halilibrahimcelik.github.io/meal-recipe-app/).

 My goal is to create basic recipe application. 

So as to  fetch the data, I used  "https://api.edamam.com/" API.

This is the first time I practised private and  authtenticaded routes .
 
 Techniques that I  implemented in this project;
 
 --Creating basic login page for the authentication,
 --Using React-Router  Library to facilitate easy page transisition.
--Adopting Styled Components for styling each and every component
--Using Themes and Global variables 
--Creating custom react hook by using useContext for authentication.
